=========

[Fat Berris][1] is an electronic music blog with a great radio. Unfortunately
there are only two ways to listen: a smartphone app or the [html5-beta
player][2] (which uses Flash - seriously).

Well, we're running an mpd.

The command line tool for creating a m3u playlistfile is simply `fatberris`,
but there's also a webservice where you can fetch it at [service.kbct.de][3].

Have fun!
